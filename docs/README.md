# OctoAcme Project Management Docs README

## Overview
OctoAcme project management follows a customer-first, iterative approach designed to deliver value quickly while managing risk and dependencies. Projects move through a lightweight lifecycle—initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective—with clear artifacts (one-pager, backlog, risk register, release notes) that act as a single source of truth for the team and stakeholders.

Our workflows emphasize small, testable increments, explicit ownership, and data-informed decisions. The team uses a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), a disciplined pull request process (small PRs, linked issues, CI checks, at least one approval), and timeboxed planning and retrospectives to keep delivery predictable and continuously improving.

Key personas include Product Managers (define outcomes and success metrics), Project Managers (coordinate delivery, risks, and communications), Developers (implement and test), and QA (validate acceptance). Regular cadences—daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, PM+PdM alignment, and monthly stakeholder updates—ensure transparency and timely escalation of blockers.

Quality assurance is integrated into the flow via unit/integration tests, CI security scans, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and manual QA when needed. Pre-release checklists, rollback plans, and incident playbooks reduce production risk and make releases observable and repeatable.

## How to use these docs
Keep the Project Charter (one-pager) updated in the project repo and use this README as the single entry point for process guidance. If you use Copilot Spaces, add process-specific docs to `.copilot/` to include them in the workspace context.
