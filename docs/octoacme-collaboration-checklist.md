## Key Handoff Points

### Design → Development
- **What**: Design specifications, assets, prototypes
- **When**: Before development work begins
- **Validation**: Design review meeting, developer sign-off

### Development → QA
- **What**: Completed features, test instructions, PR links
- **When**: After code review approval
- **Validation**: QA test plan execution, acceptance sign-off

### QA → DevOps
- **What**: Deployment-ready builds, smoke test results
- **When**: After QA validation passes
- **Validation**: Staging environment testing, deployment approval

### DevOps → Customer Success
- **What**: Release notes, feature documentation, known issues
- **When**: After production deployment
- **Validation**: Customer communication sent, support team briefed

### Product/Data Analyst → Product Manager
- **What**: Usage metrics, customer feedback, impact analysis
- **When**: 1-2 weeks post-release
- **Validation**: Success metric review, iteration planning

## Communication Best Practices

- **Be proactive**: Don't wait for others to ask—share updates early
- **Be specific**: Provide context and details, not just status
- **Be responsive**: Reply to requests within agreed timeframes
- **Be transparent**: Share risks and blockers without fear
- **Document decisions**: Keep a record of key choices and rationale
- **Tag relevant people**: Ensure the right stakeholders are informed
- **Use shared tools**: Keep information in accessible, central locations

## Escalation Guidelines

If collaboration breaks down or handoffs are unclear:
1. Raise concern in daily standup or team sync
2. Reach out to Scrum Master/Agile Coach for facilitation
3. Escalate to Project Manager for cross-team coordination
4. Involve Product Manager or leadership if impacting delivery

This checklist ensures accountability, reduces ambiguity, and fosters a culture of collaboration across all project phases.
