# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (include PM, PdM, Developers, UX Designer, DevOps Engineer, QA, and other relevant roles)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (collaborate with UX Designer on user experience requirements)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) - include quality, security, UX, and deployment criteria
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (coordinate with DevOps Engineer on infrastructure needs)
6. Create release plan and milestone map (align with Customer Success on customer communication timing)
7. Establish metrics and instrumentation plan (partner with Data Analyst on tracking requirements)
